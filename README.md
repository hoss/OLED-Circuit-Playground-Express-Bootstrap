# OLED Circuit Playground Express Bootstrap

Bootstrap for projects using Adafruit’s [Circuit Playground Express][1] with SSD1306 OLED display.

## Inspiration.

The lovely people at Adafruit kept sending me a free Circuit Playground Express with each of my orders, so when I had the opportunity to build an installation for Hyperborea, I decided to use these boards as they gave me so many sensors and LEDs on the board itself.

I use the 128x32 SSD1306 OLED in most of my projects, and I tend to favour [the Featherwing package][2] as it’s the cheapest available from Adafruit, and comes with three hardware buttons.
